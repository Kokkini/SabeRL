# Research: Base Game Arena

**Feature**: Base Game Arena  
**Date**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Complete

## Technology Decisions

### HTML5 Canvas for 2D Rendering

**Decision**: Use HTML5 Canvas API for game rendering  
**Rationale**: 
- Native browser support for 2D graphics
- Direct pixel manipulation for game entities
- Hardware acceleration available
- No external dependencies required
- Perfect for real-time game rendering

**Alternatives considered**:
- SVG: Too slow for real-time rendering, better for static graphics
- WebGL: Overkill for 2D game, adds complexity
- CSS animations: Limited control over game logic integration

### JavaScript Game Loop Architecture

**Decision**: Use requestAnimationFrame-based game loop with Entity-Component-System pattern  
**Rationale**:
- requestAnimationFrame provides smooth 60 FPS rendering
- ECS pattern separates concerns (entities, systems, components)
- Modular design enables easy testing and maintenance
- Browser-optimized timing for smooth gameplay

**Alternatives considered**:
- setInterval: Less smooth, not synchronized with display refresh
- Monolithic game class: Harder to test and maintain
- Web Workers: Unnecessary complexity for single-threaded game

### Coordinate System Design

**Decision**: Use separate logical coordinate system (20x20 units) with pixel conversion  
**Rationale**:
- Game logic independent of screen resolution
- Easy to scale to different screen sizes
- Consistent gameplay across devices
- Simple collision detection with unit-based math

**Alternatives considered**:
- Direct pixel coordinates: Breaks on different screen sizes
- Multiple coordinate systems: Adds complexity
- Fixed pixel dimensions: Not responsive

### Input Handling Strategy

**Decision**: Event-driven input with continuous movement while keys held  
**Rationale**:
- Smooth movement experience
- Prevents input spam issues
- Standard web game input pattern
- Easy to implement with addEventListener

**Alternatives considered**:
- Discrete movement per keypress: Less smooth gameplay
- Input buffering: Unnecessary complexity for simple game
- Touch controls: Not required for desktop-focused game

### AI Implementation Approach

**Decision**: Simple random movement with configurable timing  
**Rationale**:
- Easy to implement and test
- Provides adequate challenge for initial version
- Configurable difficulty through timing parameters
- No complex AI algorithms needed

**Alternatives considered**:
- Pathfinding AI: Overkill for simple arena game
- Machine learning AI: Too complex for base game
- Rule-based AI: More complex than needed

### Configuration Management

**Decision**: External config.js file with game parameters  
**Rationale**:
- Easy to tune game balance without code changes
- Centralized parameter management
- Enables quick iteration and testing
- No build process required for config changes

**Alternatives considered**:
- Hardcoded values: Difficult to adjust
- JSON config: Unnecessary parsing overhead
- Environment variables: Not applicable for client-side

## Performance Considerations

### Rendering Optimization
- Use Canvas 2D context for optimal 2D performance
- Minimize draw calls by batching operations
- Clear canvas efficiently between frames
- Avoid unnecessary redraws

### Memory Management
- Reuse object instances where possible
- Avoid creating new objects in game loop
- Use object pools for frequently created/destroyed objects
- Monitor memory usage in browser dev tools

### Input Performance
- Debounce rapid key events
- Use efficient event listeners
- Avoid blocking operations in input handlers
- Optimize collision detection algorithms

## Browser Compatibility

### Minimum Requirements
- Chrome 57+ (Canvas 2D support)
- Firefox 52+ (requestAnimationFrame)
- Safari 11+ (ES6 support)
- Edge 16+ (modern JavaScript)

### Progressive Enhancement
- Graceful degradation for older browsers
- Feature detection for Canvas support
- Fallback messaging for unsupported browsers
- Responsive design for mobile devices

## Security Considerations

### Client-Side Security
- No sensitive data processing
- Input validation for game parameters
- XSS prevention in any dynamic content
- No external API calls

### Data Privacy
- No user data collection
- No analytics tracking
- Local storage only for game preferences
- No server communication

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Jest for JavaScript unit tests
- Test individual game systems
- Mock Canvas API for testing
- Test collision detection algorithms

### Integration Testing
- Manual browser testing
- Cross-browser compatibility testing
- Performance testing on different devices
- User acceptance testing

### Performance Testing
- Frame rate monitoring
- Memory usage profiling
- Input lag measurement
- Load time optimization
