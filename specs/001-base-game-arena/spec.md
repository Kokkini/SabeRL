# Feature Specification: Base Game Arena

**Feature Branch**: `001-base-game-arena`  
**Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Base game: Top-down 2D arena with 2 players, each is a circle with a rotating saber. If the saber touches the opponent, you win."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-01-27

- Q: How should the game handle simultaneous saber contact between both players? → A: Both players win (tie game, restart)
- Q: What should be the arena size and initial player positioning? → A: 20x20 unit coordinate system, 1 unit player diameter
- Q: What should be the saber size and rotation speed? → A: 2 unit length saber, 1 round per second, stored in config.js
- Q: What should be the player movement speed and style? → A: 5 units per second continuous movement, stored in config.js
- Q: How should the AI opponent move and make decisions? → A: AI changes direction every 0.5-2 seconds randomly, moves at same speed as player
- Q: How does the system handle rapid key presses or held keys? → A: Continuous movement while key held, ignore rapid presses
- Q: What occurs if a player disconnects or stops responding during gameplay? → A: Not applicable - single player game (human vs AI)
- Q: How does the game handle different screen sizes or aspect ratios? → A: Scale to fit screen while maintaining aspect ratio

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Play Arena Combat Game (Priority: P1)

A player wants to engage in a competitive 2D arena battle where they control a character with a rotating weapon to defeat their opponent.

**Why this priority**: This is the core gameplay experience that defines the entire game. Without this basic combat interaction, there is no game.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by launching the game, moving a character with WASD, and having the rotating saber make contact with an opponent to achieve victory.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** two players are in the arena, **When** one player's rotating saber touches the opponent, **Then** that player wins the game
2. **Given** a player is in the arena, **When** they press WASD keys, **Then** their character moves in the corresponding direction
3. **Given** a player is in the arena, **When** time passes, **Then** their saber rotates at constant speed
4. **Given** two players are in the arena, **When** the game starts, **Then** both players can move and their sabers rotate simultaneously

### User Story 2 - Human vs AI Gameplay (Priority: P2)

A human player wants to play against an AI opponent that moves randomly to practice and enjoy the game solo.

**Why this priority**: Enables single-player gameplay which is essential for practice, testing, and accessibility when no human opponent is available.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by starting a game with AI opponent, observing random movement behavior, and successfully winning or losing against the AI.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a human player starts a game, **When** AI opponent is selected, **Then** the AI moves randomly within the arena bounds
2. **Given** a human player is playing against AI, **When** the AI's saber touches the human player, **Then** the AI wins
3. **Given** a human player is playing against AI, **When** the human's saber touches the AI, **Then** the human wins

### User Story 3 - Arena Boundaries and Collision (Priority: P3)

Players need to understand the arena boundaries and have their movement constrained to prevent them from leaving the playable area.

**Why this priority**: Establishes the game world boundaries and prevents players from moving outside the intended play area, maintaining fair gameplay.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by attempting to move a character to the arena edges and verifying they cannot move beyond the boundaries.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a player is near the arena edge, **When** they try to move beyond the boundary, **Then** their movement is blocked at the edge
2. **Given** a player is in the center of the arena, **When** they move in any direction, **Then** they can move freely until reaching an edge
3. **Given** both players are in the arena, **When** they move around, **Then** neither can escape the arena boundaries

### Edge Cases

- What happens when both players' sabers touch simultaneously? → Both players win (tie game, restart)
- How does the system handle rapid key presses or held keys? → Continuous movement while key held, ignore rapid presses
- What occurs if a player disconnects or stops responding during gameplay? → Not applicable - single player game (human vs AI)
- How does the game handle different screen sizes or aspect ratios? → Scale to fit screen while maintaining aspect ratio

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST display a top-down 2D arena with fixed boundaries (20x20 unit coordinate system)
- **FR-002**: System MUST render two circular player characters in the arena (1 unit diameter each)
- **FR-003**: System MUST display a rotating saber attached to each player character (2 unit length)
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow player movement using WASD keys (W=up, A=left, S=down, D=right) at 5 units per second continuous movement
- **FR-005**: System MUST rotate sabers at constant speed automatically (1 round per second)
- **FR-006**: System MUST detect when a saber touches an opponent character
- **FR-007**: System MUST declare the winner when a saber touches an opponent
- **FR-008**: System MUST prevent player movement beyond arena boundaries
- **FR-009**: System MUST support AI opponent that changes direction every 0.5-2 seconds randomly and moves at same speed as player
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle simultaneous input from both human and AI players
- **FR-011**: System MUST detect simultaneous saber contact and declare both players winners (tie game)
- **FR-012**: System MUST restart the game automatically after a tie game
- **FR-013**: System MUST use a separate coordinate system (20x20 units) and convert to pixels only for rendering
- **FR-014**: System MUST scale the coordinate system to fit different screen sizes while maintaining aspect ratio
- **FR-015**: System MUST store all game configuration (arena size, player size, saber length, rotation speed, movement speed, AI behavior timing) in a config.js file
- **FR-016**: System MUST provide continuous movement while keys are held and ignore rapid key press spam
