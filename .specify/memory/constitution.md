# SabeRL Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Browser-First Architecture
All functionality MUST run entirely in the browser without server dependencies. No backend services, APIs, or external data sources required for core RL training functionality. Static site deployment only - no server-side processing, databases, or cloud dependencies.

### II. Client-Side Training
Reinforcement learning training MUST execute locally in the browser using WebAssembly, Web Workers, or pure JavaScript implementations. Training data, model weights, and training progress MUST persist locally using browser storage mechanisms (IndexedDB, localStorage, or Web Locks API).

### III. Performance Optimization
All algorithms MUST be optimized for browser constraints: memory limits, CPU efficiency, and responsive UI. Training processes MUST be interruptible and resumable. Use Web Workers for intensive computations to prevent UI blocking. Implement progressive loading and streaming for large datasets.

### IV. Progressive Enhancement
The application MUST gracefully degrade based on browser capabilities. Core RL functionality MUST work in modern browsers with WebAssembly support. Enhanced features (WebGL acceleration, advanced storage) SHOULD be optional optimizations that don't break core functionality.

### V. Data Sovereignty
All user data, training progress, and model artifacts MUST remain on the user's device. No data transmission to external servers unless explicitly authorized by user. Implement robust local storage with backup/export capabilities for user data portability.

## Technical Constraints

### Browser Compatibility
- Minimum: Modern browsers with WebAssembly support (Chrome 57+, Firefox 52+, Safari 11+)
- Target: Latest 2 major versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- Mobile: Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities for mobile training sessions

## Development Workflow

### Code Quality Gates
- All code must pass ESLint with strict configuration
- TypeScript for type safety in complex RL algorithms
- Automated testing in CI/CD pipeline

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices. Amendments require:
1. Documentation of the change rationale
2. Impact analysis on existing functionality
3. Migration plan for breaking changes
4. Approval through project maintainer review

All pull requests must verify compliance with these principles. Complexity must be justified with performance or functionality benefits. Use browser developer tools and performance profiling for optimization guidance.
